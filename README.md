# Description

A research project that tries to understand the current state of Dockerfiles on GitHub in terms of smells.

Currently, aimed at comparing results of the previous [findings](https://github.com/VladCroitoru/dockerfile_smells_project) and the results based on Dockerfiles from the Engineered Software Projects [dataset](https://reporeapers.github.io/results/1.html).
